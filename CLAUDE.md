## ðŸŽ¯ BLUEPRINT WORKFLOW - ALWAYS START HERE
**CRITICAL: Before any development work, Claude must enter blueprint/plan mode to establish project vision.**

### Blueprint Discovery Process
When starting any new project or major feature:
1. **Enter Plan Mode** - Use plan mode to understand what we're building
2. **Ask the 5 Key Questions:**
   - What type of web application are we building?
   - What are the core features you envision?
   - Who are the users and what problems does this solve?
   - Technical preferences (frontend, database, auth, APIs)?
   - Scope and timeline (learning project, MVP, full app)?
3. **Create/Update blueprint.md** - Document the vision before coding
4. **Validate Understanding** - Confirm blueprint with user before implementation
5. **Only then proceed** - Exit plan mode and begin development

### Workflow Commands
- `lets go back to plan mode and deeply understand what we are building` - Re-enter discovery
- `create a blueprint for our project` - Start blueprint documentation
- `solidify our project vision` - Review and confirm direction

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

**EXCEPTION: blueprint.md is REQUIRED for project clarity and should be created during discovery phase.**
