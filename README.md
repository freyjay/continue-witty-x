# 🚀 Continue-Witty v2.7 EXTERNAL

**Professional AI Collaboration Continuity System**

Continue-Witty enables seamless handoffs between Claude Code instances when you hit context limits or need to continue conversations later. Instead of losing context and starting over, preserve your entire collaborative state and reasoning process.

## ✨ What This Solves

**The Problem:** Claude Code conversations hit context limits, forcing you to start over and lose:
- ❌ Project context and current state
- ❌ Reasoning behind decisions  
- ❌ Technical implementation progress
- ❌ Collaborative flow and momentum

**The Solution:** Continue-Witty creates comprehensive context packages that preserve:
- ✅ **Complete project state** - files, progress, technical context
- ✅ **Conversation reasoning** - WHY decisions were made (v2.7 feature)
- ✅ **Collaborative momentum** - seamless handoff to new Claude instance
- ✅ **Smart monitoring** - automatic backups before hitting limits

## 🎯 Key Features

### 📦 Three-Tier Context Packaging
- **Light:** Quick session summary (< 30 seconds)
- **Full:** Comprehensive project state (1-2 minutes)  
- **Complex:** Complete context + conversation reasoning (2-3 minutes)

### 🧠 Conversation Export (v2.7)
- Preserves **reasoning chains** and **decision-making process**
- Captures **WHY** behind technical choices
- Includes **problem-solving approaches** and **strategic discussions**
- **15-50KB** conversation context vs **500KB-2MB** screenshots

### 🌸 Enhanced Bloom Restoration
- **Git-like rollback** to any previous snapshot
- **Full context restoration** with reasoning preservation
- **Seamless handoffs** between Claude instances
- **Professional restoration** with comprehensive instructions

### ⚡ Smart Monitoring
- **Context window monitoring** - alerts at 85% usage
- **Credit monitoring** - detects approaching limits
- **Session duration tracking** - prevents unexpected cutoffs
- **Unified coordination** - intelligent backup triggers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or download continue-witty-external
cd continue-witty-external
./install.sh
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# In Claude Code, when approaching context limits:
/continue-witty full

# Later, in new Claude instance:
/bloom
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Create comprehensive backup with reasoning
/continue-witty complex

# Monitor your session proactively  
continue-witty monitor

# List available snapshots
python3 ~/.continue-witty/scripts/enhanced-bloom-system.py list

# Restore specific snapshot
python3 ~/.continue-witty/scripts/enhanced-bloom-system.py restore snapshot-5
```

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Context Preservation
When you run `/continue-witty`, the system:
1. **Analyzes current state** - files, git status, session progress
2. **Captures conversation reasoning** - recent decision-making process (v2.7)
3. **Creates comprehensive package** - technical + reasoning context
4. **Stores snapshot** - organized, timestamped, and tagged

### 2. Bloom Restoration  
When you run `/bloom`, the system:
1. **Lists available snapshots** - organized by recency and type
2. **Restores chosen context** - complete project and reasoning state
3. **Provides handoff instructions** - seamless transition to new Claude
4. **Preserves continuity** - no context loss, maintains momentum

### 3. Smart Monitoring
The monitoring system runs continuously to:
1. **Track context usage** - warns before hitting limits
2. **Monitor credit consumption** - alerts on approaching thresholds  
3. **Watch session duration** - prevents unexpected cutoffs
4. **Coordinate backups** - automatic preservation when needed

## 🎭 Real-World Example

**Before Continue-Witty:**
```
Claude: "I'd help, but I need context about your project..."
You: *spends 20 minutes re-explaining everything*
Claude: "Ok, now I understand. Let's start over..."
```

**With Continue-Witty:**
```
New Claude: "I see from the snapshot we were implementing the authentication system. 
The conversation context shows you decided on JWT over sessions because of the mobile 
app requirements we discussed. Let me continue from line 47 in auth.py..."
```

## 📦 Package Types Explained

### Light Package (~30 seconds)
- Session summary and current state
- Recent file changes
- Immediate next steps
- **Best for:** Quick handoffs, simple continuations

### Full Package (1-2 minutes)  
- Complete project analysis
- Technical implementation details
- File system state and git status
- **Best for:** Mid-project handoffs, comprehensive context

### Complex Package (2-3 minutes)
- Everything in Full package
- **Conversation reasoning export** (v2.7 feature)
- Decision-making context and problem-solving approaches
- **Best for:** Long-term project continuity, critical handoffs

## 🌸 Bloom Restoration Deep Dive

Bloom restoration is like **git for AI conversations**:

```bash
# See available "commits" (snapshots)
/bloom list

# "Checkout" any previous state
/bloom restore snapshot-5

# Your new Claude instance gets:
# ✅ Complete project context
# ✅ Technical implementation state  
# ✅ Reasoning behind decisions (v2.7)
# ✅ Seamless continuation instructions
```

## ⚡ Smart Monitoring Details

### Context Window Monitoring
- Tracks tokens used vs context limit
- Warns at 85% usage (configurable)
- Suggests backup before hitting limit

### Credit Monitoring  
- Detects "approaching usage limit" messages
- Monitors reset times and usage patterns
- Triggers automatic backups when credits low

### Session Duration Tracking
- Monitors actual usage time (not wall-clock time)
- Accounts for thinking pauses and breaks
- Warns before typical session cutoff times

### Unified Coordination
- Single coordinator manages all monitoring
- Prevents duplicate alerts and backups
- Intelligent prioritization of concerns

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `~/.continue-witty/config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.7.0-external",
  "monitoring": {
    "context_window_threshold": 0.85,
    "credit_monitoring": true,
    "session_duration_hours": 4.5,
    "auto_backup": true
  },
  "packages": {
    "default_type": "full",
    "conversation_export": true,
    "max_exchanges": 10
  },
  "bloom_restoration": {
    "auto_show_instructions": true,
    "preserve_history": true
  }
}
```
